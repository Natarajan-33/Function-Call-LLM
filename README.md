# Function Calling Demo with Streamlit

This project demonstrates how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform **function calling** with a set of synthetic tools, all through a simple and interactive Streamlit web app.

## Features

- **Natural Language Interface:** Enter prompts in plain English; the LLM decides which tool(s) to call.
- **Tool Integration:** The app supports the following tools:
  - **Weather:** Get the current weather for any location.
  - **Time:** Get the current time in any location.
  - **News:** Fetch a plausible news headline about a topic.
  - **Sum Calculator:** Add two numbers.
  - **Joke:** Get a random joke.
  - **Quote:** Get an inspirational quote.
- **LLM-Powered:** Uses the [Groq API](https://groq.com/) with the `llama3-70b-8192` model for both function calling and tool responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys) (free to sign up)
- Streamlit

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Function-call.git
   cd Function-call
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
     ```
   - Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key.

### Running the App

```bash
streamlit run app_streamlit.py
```

The app will open in your browser. Enter a prompt (e.g., `What's the weather in Paris and tell me a joke?`) and click **Submit**.

## How It Works

- The app sends your prompt to the LLM via the Groq API.
- The LLM decides which tool(s) to call and with what parameters.
- The app executes the tool(s) and displays the results, including the tool name, parameters, and output.

## File Overview

- `app_streamlit.py` — The main Streamlit app.
- `tools.py` — Implements the synthetic tools and their LLM-based logic.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.

## Example Prompts

- `What's the weather in New York?`
- `Give me the latest news about AI and a quote.`
- `Add 5 and 7, and tell me the time in Tokyo.`

## Notes

- All tool outputs are **synthetic** (generated by the LLM), not real API calls.
- The app is for demonstration and educational purposes.
